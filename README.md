## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pradeepx-dev/Kabutr.git
   cd Kabutr
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the port specified in `app.py`)

### Production Deployment

For production deployment (e.g., on Render, Heroku, or similar platforms):

1. Ensure `Procfile` is configured correctly
2. Set appropriate environment variables
3. Use a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn)
4. Configure proper security headers and HTTPS

## Usage

### Encoding a Message (Hiding)

1. Navigate to the application homepage
2. Click on the **"Encrypt & Hide Message"** tab
3. Upload a PNG or JPG image file
4. Enter the secret message you wish to hide
5. Set a strong password (used for encryption)
6. Click **"Encrypt & Hide Message"**
7. Download the generated stego image

**Note**: The stego image will appear visually identical to the original image.

### Decoding a Message (Revealing)

1. Navigate to the application homepage
2. Click on the **"Decrypt & Reveal Message"** tab
3. Upload the stego image that contains the hidden message
4. Enter the password used during encoding
5. Click **"Decrypt & Reveal Message"**
6. The decrypted message will be displayed

**Important**: You must use the exact same password that was used during encoding. Incorrect passwords will result in an error message.

## How It Works

### Encryption Process

1. **Key Derivation**: The user's password is processed through PBKDF2HMAC with:
   - Algorithm: SHA-256
   - Iterations: 100,000
   - Salt: 16-byte random salt (unique per message)
   - Key Length: 32 bytes (256 bits)

2. **Message Encryption**: The plaintext message is encrypted using Fernet (AES-128 in CBC mode) with the derived key.

3. **Payload Construction**: The encrypted data is packaged with:
   - **Length Header** (4 bytes): Total payload size
   - **Magic Header** (4 bytes): `STG1` identifier for validation
   - **Salt** (16 bytes): Random salt used for key derivation
   - **Encrypted Data**: The Fernet-encrypted message

### Steganography Process

1. **Image Preparation**: The input image is converted to RGB format (3 channels) with uint8 data type.

2. **Capacity Check**: The application verifies that the image has sufficient pixels to store the payload:
   - Required bits = (4 + 4 + 16 + encrypted_data_length) × 8
   - Available bits = image_height × image_width × 3

3. **LSB Embedding**: 
   - The payload is converted to a binary bit stream
   - Each bit is embedded into the least significant bit of image pixel values
   - The image is flattened to a 1D array for efficient processing
   - Bits are embedded sequentially across all color channels

4. **Image Reconstruction**: The modified pixel array is reshaped back to the original image dimensions.

### Decryption Process

1. **LSB Extraction**: The least significant bits are extracted from the stego image pixels.

2. **Length Validation**: The first 32 bits (4 bytes) are read to determine the payload length.

3. **Magic Header Verification**: The next 32 bits are checked for the `STG1` magic header to ensure valid steganography data.

4. **Salt Extraction**: The 16-byte salt is extracted from the payload.

5. **Key Derivation**: The same PBKDF2HMAC process is used with the extracted salt to derive the decryption key.

6. **Message Decryption**: The encrypted data is decrypted using Fernet and the derived key.

## Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Security

- **Strong Encryption**: AES-256 encryption provides industry-standard security
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations makes brute-force attacks computationally expensive
- **Random Salt**: Each message uses a unique salt, preventing rainbow table attacks
- **Secure Random Generation**: Uses `os.urandom()` for cryptographically secure random number generation

### Steganography Security

- **Invisibility**: LSB modification is imperceptible to human eyes
- **Format Preservation**: Output images maintain visual fidelity
- **Magic Header**: Prevents false positives and validates data integrity

### Best Practices

- **Password Strength**: Users should use strong, unique passwords
- **Image Selection**: Larger images provide more capacity and better security through obscurity
- **Secure Transmission**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
- **Data Disposal**: Securely delete original images and messages after use if handling sensitive data

### Limitations

- **Capacity Constraints**: Message size is limited by image dimensions
- **Format Requirements**: Input images must be in PNG or JPG format
- **Password Dependency**: Lost passwords result in permanent data loss (by design)
- **Not Quantum-Resistant**: Current encryption algorithms are not quantum-resistant
